Overview
--------

Selexe run tests generated by Selenium IDE, from the command line or side by side your application testsuite, using the
Selenium Webdriver API.

Selenium IDE is an widely and easy-to-use application for recording, editing and running selenium tests, its main
issue is it's tied to firefox and its API is based on the legacy Selenium core, in addition to a set of fairly broken
Webdriver language-specific exporters.

This project aims full compatibility with test files generated by Selenium IDE, with especial care on mimicking its
behavior, using Selenium 2 (Selenium Webdriver).

Install
-------

Creating virtualenv (recommended):

.. code:: sh

    # with python2
    virtualenv env
    . env/bin/activate

.. code:: sh

    # with python3 (broken on Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10)
    python -m venv env
    . env/bin/activate

Once in virtualenv, you can install selexe directly from this git repository using pip.

.. code:: sh

    pip install git+https://github.com/ralhei/selexe.git
